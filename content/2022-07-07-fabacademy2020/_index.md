In 2020 I completed the Fab Academy, an intensive program about designing and prototyping projects using digital fabrication tools and machine, such as: computer-controlled cutting, electronics, 3D scanning and printing, electronics design,computer-controlled machining, embedded programming, molding and casting, networking and communications, mechanical design, interface and application programming and machine design.

I have documented everything I learned during the programme on this website. It is organized by themes, which are the assignments we were asked to do each week.
Feel free to consult it as much as I do.

Memory is never as good as we think it is.
