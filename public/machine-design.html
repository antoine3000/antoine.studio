<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>For the Machine Design week at the Fab Academy, we were asked to make a machine of any type, but one that we could operate and automate. I teamed up with <a class="external" href="https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/barcelona/students/benjamin-scott/" target="_blank">Benjamin Scott</a> and we decided to go for a machine that plays Pong again itself. We call it the <em>Pong Machine</em>.</p>
<p>First of all, we had to find out how to make the machine we had in mind, which was not easy when we launched this project in June 2020, towards the official end of the Academy. A few months later, as the Covid-19 crisis subsides, we have a better understanding of the tools we have in the lab, how the mechanics work, what we have to produce by ourselves and what we can take from others.</p>
<p>I'm very happy with the way our project went, even if we didn't reach the final stage we were aiming for: Our machine doesn't play pong. But it can move its pallet according to the position of the ball, which is already something great for us. More time and testing could help us to develop the final version of our machine, perhaps in the near future? Let's see how it goes.</p>

<h1 id="task-management">Task management</h1>
<p>With Benjamin, we did almost the whole project together because it was easier for us to learn the different steps together and help each other in real time. It's certainly not the best way to go fast, but it's certainly the best way to learn and act as a team. Nevertheless, we naturally divided the tasks according to our personal taste.</p>

<p>Benjamin did the ball detection part. He prepared the field and made sure that our line detection logic worked properly, from the choice of equipment to the electronics to make it work. He also built the rails and made the connectors to make them stand upright.</p>
<h2 id="antoine">Antoine</h2>
<p>I designed and fabricated the mounting plate on which we attached the stepper motor and solenoid (which would be used to push the ball forward) and a 3D printed support for the solenoid.I also did the coding part of the project, so that we could move the motor according to what the lines say. I really enjoy solving logic problems.</p>
